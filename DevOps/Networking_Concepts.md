1. Intro to network devices
  - **Layer 1 devices**:
    - The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was developed as a way to help disparate computing systems communicate with each other.
    - OSI reference model has 7 layers:
      - Layer1 - Physical
      - Layer2 - Data Link
      - Layer3 - Network
      - Layer4 - Transpot
      - Layer5 - Session
      - Layer6 - Presentation
      - Layer7 - Application
    - Analog modem(modulator/demodulator)
      - was developed to take the digital signal coming from a digital node and convert it to an analog signal (modulating the signal) to be placed on the wire. In return, it would accept an analog signal from the wire and convert it (demodulating the signal) to a digital signal that the node could understand.
      - modems provide for a single connection to a network
    - Hub
      - A hub functions as a concentrator/repeater in that it doesn't care where the signal comes from or where it is going. It takes the electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out all of the othere ports.
      - It may have just a few ports, or many ports(not very common in morden networking)
  - **Layer 2 devices**
    - Switch:
      - A switch utilizes an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip. The chip has specific programing that allows the switch to learnwhen a device is on the network and which ports it is connected to via that device's Layer 2 MAC address.
      - A switch may have just a few ports or many ports
      - A switch can be very simple, or it can be highly complex and programmable.
      - A switch will only communicates with the local network devices.
    - Wireless access point(WAP)
      - A WAP is a specific type of network bridge that connects (bridges) wireless network segments with wired network segments. The most common type of WAP bridges 802.11 wireless network segments with 802.3 Ethernet network segments.
      - A WAP will only communicates with local network devices.
  - **Layer 3 devices**
    - Multilayer switch (MLS)
      - An MLS provides normal Layer 2 network switching services, but it will also provide Layer 3 or highter OSI model services.
      - The most common MLS is a Layer 3 switch.
      - An MLS is a highly programmable and complex network device.
      - An MLS may have just a few ports or many ports.
    - Router
      - A router is the most common network device for connecting different networks together utilizing the OSI model's Layer 3 logical network information.
      - The router uses software programming for decision making as compared to the switch's use of an ASIC chip. The router uses this programing to keep track of differenct networks and what it considers to be the best possible route to reach those networks.
      - A router can communicate with both local and no-local network devices.
